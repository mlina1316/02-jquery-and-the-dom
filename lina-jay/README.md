# Lab 02 - jQuery and the DOM
**Author**: Lina Jay
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)
## Overview
We want to build a blog that lists articles chronologically with the most recent articles on the top. We want it to be easy to navigate on mobile and desktop.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
We first need to run our app from live-server. We also need to set up our initial applications scaffold. We need to ensure that the code works in both mobile and desktop viewports.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
We will be building our style sheets with SMACSS guidelines. We will also be using jQuery for access, traversal and manipulation of the DOM. We will be using DRY principles in our code and optimizing iteration with javascript array methods.

## Change Log
<!-- Use this are to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples:
