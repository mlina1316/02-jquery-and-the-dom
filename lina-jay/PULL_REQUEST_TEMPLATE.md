#### Single-line Summary
**This took ~3 hours to complete.**

#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
  1. First we placed in our script tags for jQuery, then blogArticles.js, then article.js
  2. Creating the Object constructor is pretty straight forward, as the blog articles have the keys needed
  3. We removed the class .template from our article template, which otherwise causes the browser to freeze
  4. Next we placed our traversal and setter methods to fit each object key/value into it's element
  5. Finally we refactored the for loops into the native .forEach method.
